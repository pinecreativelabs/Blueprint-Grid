Blueprint Grid is a multimethod CSS library for creating responsive layouts for mobile apps and websites. It is free and open source under the MIT license. Blueprint Grid is the layout component for [Brutalist Framework](http://www.brutalistframework.com). 

There are four methods for creating layouts: 
1. **B3Grid**: Blocks and Bricks Base Grid (Flexbox-based)
2. **CSS grid**: auto-adjusting layouts based on CSS grid
3. **Print Grid**: paper-friendly print grid
4. **PolyGrids**: creative grids with multiple dimensions
5. **Chaos Grid**: anti-grid grid

## Getting Started
You will only need: **/source/blueprintgrid.css**

This file will import all the grid method CSS files from the **source/methods** directory.

If you only need a specific method, you can find each grid method in the **/source/methods/** folder in their own CSS files.
