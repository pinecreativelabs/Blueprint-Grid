# Blueprint-Grid
Blueprint Grid is a multimethod CSS library for creating responsive layouts for mobile apps and websites. It is free and open source under the MIT license. Blueprint Grid is the layout component for [Brutalist Framework](http://www.brutalistframework.com). 

There are four methods for creating layouts: 
1. **B3Grid**: Blocks and Bricks Base Grid (Flexbox-based)
2. **CSS grid**: auto-adjusting layouts based on CSS grid
3. **Print Grid**: paper-friendly print grid
4. **PolyGrids**: creative grids with multiple dimensions

## Getting Started
For B3Grid, CSS Grid, and Print Grid, you will need the **/source/blueprintgrid.css** file. 

To make a PolyGrid, you only need the **/source/blueprintgrid_polygrids.css** file.

Both of the above files are also available in a minified format. 

### Documentation
You can find documentation in the [Blueprint Grid Wiki](https://github.com/pinecreativelabs/Blueprint-Grid/wiki).
